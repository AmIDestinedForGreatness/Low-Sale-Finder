# Yujin's Pokestop — Progress

> "We are nowhere near, but we are closer than where we were yesterday." — 2026-07-16

The compounding rule: every mistake becomes a permanent test (`tests.py`) and a
written lesson (`LESSONS.md`). Current reproducible suite on this checkout:
**124 total tests: 121 passed, 3 explicitly skipped, 0 failed; 42 lessons**
(2026-07-19).

## 2026-07-19 independent Codex audit

- Formal repository/agent evaluation: `docs/CLAUDE-CODE-AGENT-EVALUATION.md`.
- Confirmed and fixed route parity: the dashboard's separate single-card
  identifier could still display a JP set code (`m20`) as a Pokemon name after
  the canonical dataset path had already fixed that failure class.
- Isolated the Flask regressions from production uploads/failure logging and
  replaced a machine-dependent warp/hash skip with deterministic regions/quads.
- Full deterministic suite: **124 total, 121 passed, 3 skips, 0 failed**.
  Offline scraper/parser replay:
  **40/40**. All 31 Python files and the inline dashboard JavaScript parse.
- **Still unverified here:** real-photo perspective-warp/hash hit rate, route
  timing, and reaudit. This checkout has no `fingerprints.sqlite` and no
  `dataset/images`; synthetic wiring is not real-photo acceptance.
- Public deployment remains blocked pending input/transport hardening: the
  authorization boundary is now closed, but raw Flask still must not be
  internet-exposed and URL/upload hardening is the next security unit.
- Dashboard authorization correction: without `DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN` the
  server binds to `127.0.0.1` and accepts direct loopback only; with a token,
  remote requests require constant-time Basic/Bearer verification. One global
  guard covers all read/mutation routes. Oracle instructions now keep port
  5000 closed and use an SSH tunnel. Seven focused tests pass.

## Version history

| Ver | Shipped | What |
|---|---|---|
| V0.1 | 7/15 | Status dashboard: ON/OFF heartbeat, 10-min countdown, recent sends |
| V0.2 | 7/15 | Dead-man Discord ping, price-drop alerts, phone LAN access, stats |
| V0.3 | 7/15 | Logo hero, cards-only filter, restart buttons (watchlist/grails removed) |
| V0.4 | 7/16 | GMT+8 upload times, FB groups in recent list, link-click fix, no stats cards |

| V0.6 | 7/16 | Build identity badge (#git-sha) + stale-page auto-detector |
| V0.7 | 7/17 | **The dataset run**: all 20 shop listings identified image-first (19/20). New layers: name vocabulary snap (C), dex number (D), fingerprint ambiguity guard + tie-break, promo footers, watermark defense, `profile_dataset.py` |
| V0.8 | 7/17 | **Overnight (the overnight lot, 38 cards)**: LINK AS SOURCE on the dashboard (paste a Carousell listing URL → photos fetched → identified); orientation auto-righting; binder-page 2×2 splitting; squashed-form name matching; variant-letter numerators (24a/119); language-claim discipline; identity-strict lot pricing; `folder_dataset.py` |
| V0.9 | 7/17 | **Training shift**: Layer E attack-name ID (31,908 indexed — the binder breakthrough); local-index join + full collector numbers; mechanic-variant retry; candidate consensus; pair split; BINDER MODE on the dashboard; slab region-ambiguity guard; gallery numbers (TG/GG); 20-listing live training set graded 6 exact/8 partial/0 wrong. Lot final: 39/39 named, 27 priced (₱16,957) |

| V0.10 | 7/17 | **Evidence Engine**: governing `DIRECTIVE.md`; A-E levels, 10-step evidence chain, explicit C inference and D/E failure reports, dashboard evidence display, persistent failure database. |
| V0.11 | 7/17 | **Adversarial verification**: widened cross-print collision analyzer; Evidence Coverage split from provisional Prediction Confidence; falsification block on every result; local-only perceptual-hash ArtworkProvider + honest provider stubs; transactional/resumable two-dataset audit; narrow-photo binder fallback and invalid-number rejection. |
| V0.11.1 | 7/17 | **Facebook CPU/fairness fix**: replaced catastrophic whole-page PriceCharting regex with bounded row parsing; removed duplicate per-post valuation; added 500ms hover/45s collection caps, auction maintenance between groups, and explicit Marketplace state. One sequential burner browser, no ban-risky parallelism. |
| V0.12 | 7/18 | **Mixed-set binder day**: contour-based card-region detection (`detect_card_regions`/`probe_contours`, geometry not text — catches pages the text signals can't); contour-first ordering ahead of the blind 2×2 grid; 12-card lattice completion (a 3×4 page can never come back as 11); hash-first lookup with numpy-vectorized `match_image()` (2-9s → 0.02s/lookup); content-hash OCR cache (warm 12-card re-run 473s → ~70-100s); `fingerprints.sqlite` refresh 20,324 → 20,444 (Mega Darkrai ex) with visual-column preservation on rebuild; live USD/PHP rate wired into all 4 price paths; cross-region number-collision documented (`224/193` = EN Orthworm AND JP Mega Froslass ex — the `len(cands)==1` gate is load-bearing); set-code-shaped garbage can no longer surface as a card name. Verified on Yujin's real 12-card JP binder photo: 12/12 detected, 4 at Level A, rest honest-unread. Suite 123/123. |

## The system (4 always-on processes)

1. **Carousell feed** (`main.py --feed`) — every new TCG listing → Discord;
   categories color-coded; sold/reserved edits; price-drop alerts;
   "♻ resurfaced" tag on bumped old posts; mismatch-guarded deal alerts
2. **FB groups feed** (`fb_feed.py`) — 15 PH TCG groups (headless burner);
   sale/timed-auction/bidding split; auction channel; 10-min end reminders
   (react-to-track); auto-delete ended auctions; bounded fair turns prevent a
   pathological group from starving the rest or blocking auction maintenance
3. **Discord bot** (`bot.py`, Pokestop#6681) — react-to-track,
   /dashboard /help /status + owner-only "." commands
4. **Dashboard** (`app.py`, V0.6) — live status, merged recent list,
   Card Valuator, webhook manager, self-identifying builds

## Card Valuator — identification stack (the core IP)

Photo in → exact printing out:

1. **RapidOCR** (local onnx; reads 9px footers Windows OCR can't; JP-safe)
2. **Name guess** — junk-shape filtering (proper-case words; glued Mega/EX
   forms allowed: MCameruptEX, HydreigonEX; two-line TAG TEAM names joined)
3. **Layer C: name vocabulary snap** — a name must be (or snap uniquely to)
   one of 4,428 REAL card names (Pikachue→Pikachu, arizardex→Charizard);
   watermark/garbage text is rejected so deeper layers take over (L21)
4. **JP footer path** — set code + collector number = unique global ID
   ("sm12a 016/173" → exactly one card); promo LETTER footers too
   ("034/XY-P", "197/SV-P") — unique catalog match = the card (L24)
5. **Attack fingerprint** — damage numbers (standalone regions only) + HP
   vs local index of 20,324 cards; ambiguity-guarded (corroboration + clear
   winner, L23); corroborated ties break against the collector number's own
   catalog matches ("fingerprint × number")
6. **Layer D: dex number** — JP vintage prints "NO.398" in the Pokédex
   strip → species ID when nothing else is readable (L24)
7. **Deep-scan** — zoomed region crops × contrast variants for glare photos
8. **Layer-B constraint snap** — the number must be a real printing of the
   identified card; unique 1-edit errors auto-correct (015/173→016/173),
   only when the name is certain/specific (L25), reported honestly
9. **Grid** — cards only (no boxes/merch), nearest-to-farthest, JP-first
   when the card is non-English, language-prefixed names
10. **The eye gate** — side-by-side confirm (your photo vs 874×1214 scan),
    click-zoom with level slider, stamps/1st-ed check. **The user's eye is
    the final identification authority.**

11. **Adversarial collision search** - same/normalized/suffix/one-slip
    collector numbers and similar names are searched across the full local
    catalog before a level is assigned; unresolved printings are downgraded.
12. **Evidence fusion** - 10-dimension Coverage and provisional rules-based
    Prediction Confidence are separate; every score lists its factors and
    every result states the strongest alternative and overturn condition.

## The dataset (`dataset/carousell_profile.json` + `profile_dataset.py`)

His task (7/16): identify all 20 shop listings from IMAGES ONLY — titles
used only to verify afterward. Result: **19/20 identified image-first**
(18 with exact printing), 1 partial (Coalossal: printing read, name
ambiguous), 1 unreadable (Rota's Mime Jr. — footer never resolves in any
photo). In 3 cases the images beat the metadata (exact printings the
titles don't carry; one title typo corrected). Five identification runs,
each failure → a new layer (L21-L25). Batch watermark defense
(cross-listing token frequency) lives in the dataset pipeline; everything
else is shared with the dashboard valuator.

Valuation: TCGplayer market + latest real sales (per-condition medians,
labeled real vs estimated) + sales-velocity confidence (HIGH/MED/LOW) +
PH sell suggestion (× factor) + steal price (≤72%).

## Pricing chain (feeds)

manual CSV → TCGplayer (strict number match, Mega-promo name variants) →
PriceCharting (specific-token matching only — L20). Coverage on his 20
Carousell listings: 19/20 (Raichu GX Korean = no public data anywhere).

## Known limits (honest)

- 810px uploads: 5/6 digit ambiguity is in the pixels (Layer-B absorbs it;
  original-resolution photos would eliminate it)
- Trainer/item cards have no attack fingerprint (name OCR carries them)
- Graded slabs: no dedicated path yet (PSA cert OCR = planned)
- Vintage (no set codes): untested
- FB comment reading (live current-bid): not built (embedded JSON, high risk)
- Korean cards: no public price data — ×0.65 JP heuristic unvalidated
- fingerprints.sqlite needs a rebuild when new sets release
  (`build_fingerprints.py`)
- Local perceptual artwork matching only works when an independent reference
  photo already exists on disk; HP/ability/set-symbol/holo remain honest stubs.
- Low-resolution 2x2 binder uploads now auto-detect, but four deep crop passes
  can take roughly three minutes on this machine.

## Roadmap

- Composite pricer step 2: blended TCG+PC × PH factor (step 1/PC precision ✅ 7/16)
- PH price index from the sniper's own accumulated data (the real snipe engine)
- Slab path (cert OCR), vintage support, condition checker (whitening-first, L17)
- eBay/Shopee/Lazada as future data sources; FB Marketplace = his decision
